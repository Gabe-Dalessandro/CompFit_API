========= INTERACTING WITH DOCKER ======== 

USEFUL FACTS:
	- When you run a container, make edits while in it, and then stop it, 		- all the changes you made DO NOT persist




BASIC COMMANDS:
	- docker images: shows all the images that exist on your machine
	- docker ps -a: lists all the containers that are created (running or stopped)
	- docker rm <ID>: removes the container with that id
	- docker rmi <ID>: removes the image with that id




BUILDING THE DOCKER IMAGE:
	- COMMAND: docker build -t compfit_server .
		- builds the image from the dockerfile within the current directory (thats the .)
		- -t gives it the name


VOLUMES:
	- allows changes within the container to persist 
	- COMMAND: docker volume create todo-db
		- this creates a volume
		- then it must be mounted onto a directory within our machine


CREATING A DOCKERFILE:


RUNNING THE IMAGE -> which creates the container:
	- when you run the image, it makes a container that you can access
	- must map the ports to access the application
	- FLAG: -p 3000:3000
		- maps the host port to the containers port

	- docker run <image-name>: builds the image and then allows you to access the container
